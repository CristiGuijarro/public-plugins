<p>The domestic guinea pig (<i>Cavia porcellus</i>), also known as cavy or cuy, is a species of rodent belonging to the family Caviidae. Despite their common name these animals are not in the pig family Suidae, nor do they come from Guinea. They originated in the Andes, and earlier studies based on biochemistry and hybridization suggest they are domestic descendants of a closely related species of cavy such as <i>C. aperea</i>, <i>C. fulgida</i>, or <i>C. tschudii</i> and, therefore, do not exist naturally in the wild. Recent studies applying molecular markers, in addition to studying the skull and skeletal morphology of current and mummified animals, revealed that the ancestor is most likely <i>Cavia tschudii</i>.</p>
