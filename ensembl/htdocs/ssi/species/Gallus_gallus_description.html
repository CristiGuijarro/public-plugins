<p>The red junglefowl (<i>Gallus gallus</i>) is a tropical member of the family Phasianidae. It is the primary progenitor of the domestic chicken (though genetic evidence strongly suggests some past hybridisation with the grey junglefowl, as well). The red junglefowl was first domesticated at least 5000 years ago in Asia. Since then, it has spread around the world, and the domestic form is kept globally as a very productive food source of both meat and eggs.</p>
