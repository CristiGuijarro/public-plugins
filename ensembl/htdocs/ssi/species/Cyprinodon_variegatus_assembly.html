<p>The C_variegatus-1.0 assembly was submitted by Aquatic Genome Models on July 2014. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 110,959 contigs assembled into 9,259 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 20,803 while the scaffold N50 is 835,301.</p>
