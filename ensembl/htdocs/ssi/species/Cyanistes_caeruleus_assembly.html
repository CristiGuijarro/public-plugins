<p>The cyaCae2 assembly was submitted by Dr. Bernd Tmmermann, NGS core facility, MPI Molecular Genetics on January 2018. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 50,541 contigs assembled into 29,297 scaffolds. From these sequences, 31 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 105,778 while the scaffold N50 is 16,846,143.</p>
