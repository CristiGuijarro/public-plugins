<p>The Ballan wrasse (<i>Labrus bergylta</i>) is a species of wrasse native to the northeastern Atlantic Ocean from Norway to Morocco, including the islands of Madeira, the Azores and the Canary Islands. All Ballan wrasses are female for their first four to 14 years before a few change into males; large Ballan wrasses are almost certainly male.</p>
