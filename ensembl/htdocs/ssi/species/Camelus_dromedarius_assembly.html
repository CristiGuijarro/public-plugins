<p>The CamDro2 assembly was submitted by Vetmeduni Vienna on May 2019. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 59,913 contigs assembled into 23,439 scaffolds. From these sequences, 37 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 204,356 while the scaffold N50 is 75,021,453.</p>
