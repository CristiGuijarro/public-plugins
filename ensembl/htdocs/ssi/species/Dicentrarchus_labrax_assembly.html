<p>The seabass_V1.0 assembly was submitted by MPI-PZ on May 2014. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 37,781 contigs assembled into 25 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 54,134 while the scaffold N50 is 26,439,989.</p>
