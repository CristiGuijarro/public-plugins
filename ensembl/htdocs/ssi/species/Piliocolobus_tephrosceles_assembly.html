<p>The ASM277652v2 assembly was submitted by University of Oregon on September 2018. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 111,069 contigs assembled into 47,449 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 98,446 while the scaffold N50 is 13,534,873.</p>
