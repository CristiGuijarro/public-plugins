<p>The Eluc_V3 assembly was submitted by Ben F Koop, Jong S Leong on January 2017. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 18,750 contigs assembled into 1,211 scaffolds. From these sequences, 25 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 125,635 while the scaffold N50 is 7,945,253.</p>
