<p>The TS10Xv2-PRI assembly was submitted by University Of New South Wales on September 2018. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 131,885 contigs assembled into 52,414 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 31,763 while the scaffold N50 is 5,997,050.</p>
