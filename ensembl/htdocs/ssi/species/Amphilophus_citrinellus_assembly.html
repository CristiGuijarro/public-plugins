<p>The Midas_v5 assembly was submitted by University Of Konstanz on September 2014. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 67,543 contigs assembled into 6,637 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 23,456 while the scaffold N50 is 1,216,136.</p>
