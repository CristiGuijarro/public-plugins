<p>The BallGen_V1 assembly was submitted by National Institute of nutrition and seafood research on May 2016. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 13,723 contigs assembled into 13,466 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 703,847 while the scaffold N50 is 794,648.</p>
