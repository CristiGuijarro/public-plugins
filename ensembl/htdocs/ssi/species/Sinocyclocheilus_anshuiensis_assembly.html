<p>The SAMN03320099.WGS_v1.1 assembly was submitted by BGI, Shenzhen on January 2016. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 254,423 contigs assembled into 85,682 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 17,271 while the scaffold N50 is 1,284,143.</p>
