<p>The common marmoset (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>) is a New World monkey. It originally lived on the northeastern coast of Brazil, but has spread southwards, becoming an invasive species in its non-native regions. It is used as model organisms in areas of research such as teratology, periodontal disease, reproduction, immunology, endocrinology, obesity and aging, and was the first New World monkey to have its genome sequenced.</p>
