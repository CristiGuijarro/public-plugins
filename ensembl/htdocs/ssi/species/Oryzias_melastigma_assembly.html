<p>The Om_v0.7.RACA assembly was submitted by Sungkyunkwan University on February 2018. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 56,275 contigs assembled into 8,603 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 30,057 while the scaffold N50 is 23,737,187.</p>
