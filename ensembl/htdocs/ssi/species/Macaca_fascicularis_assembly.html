<p>The Macaca_fascicularis_5.0 assembly was submitted by Washington University (WashU) on June 2013. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 87,764 contigs assembled into 7,625 scaffolds. From these sequences, 21 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 86,040 while the scaffold N50 is 88,649,475.</p>
