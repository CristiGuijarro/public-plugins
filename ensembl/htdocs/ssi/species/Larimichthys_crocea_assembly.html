<p>The L_crocea_2.0 assembly was submitted by BGI on November 2018. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 16,979 contigs assembled into 9,998 scaffolds. From these sequences, 24 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 277,487 while the scaffold N50 is 27,037,660.</p>
