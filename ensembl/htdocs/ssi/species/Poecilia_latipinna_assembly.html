<p>The P_latipinna-1.0 assembly was submitted by The Genome Institute at Washington University School of Medicine (WUGSC) on November 2015. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 54,625 contigs assembled into 17,988 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 33,278 while the scaffold N50 is 279,200.</p>
