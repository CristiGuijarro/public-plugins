<p>The Parus_major1.1 assembly was submitted by Animal Breeding and Genomics Centre, Wageningen University on June 2016. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 24,044 contigs assembled into 1,675 scaffolds. From these sequences, 32 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 148,693 while the scaffold N50 is 71,365,269.</p>
