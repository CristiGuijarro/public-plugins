<p>The ASM479886v1 assembly was submitted by Gladstone Institutes on April 2019. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 20,696 contigs assembled into 1,411 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 189,463 while the scaffold N50 is 23,831,982.</p>
