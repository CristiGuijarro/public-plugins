<p>The western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) is a species of freshwater fish, also known commonly, if ambiguously, as
  simply mosquitofish or by its generic name, Gambusia, or by the common name gambezi. There is also an eastern
  mosquitofish (G. holbrooki).Mosquitofish are small in comparison to many other freshwater fish, with females reaching
  an overall length of 7&nbsp;cm (2.8&nbsp;in) and males at a length of 4&nbsp;cm (1.6&nbsp;in). The female can be
  distinguished from the male by her larger size and a gravid spot at the posterior of her abdomen. The name
  &quot;mosquitofish&quot; was given because the diet of this fish sometimes consists of large numbers of mosquito
  larvae, relative to body size. Gambusia typically eat zooplankton, beetles, mayflies, caddisflies, mites, and other
  invertebrates; mosquito larvae make up only a small portion of their diet.Mosquitofish were introduced directly into
  ecosystems in many parts of the world as a biocontrol to lower mosquito populations which in turn negatively affected
  many other species in each distinct bioregion. Mosquitofish in Australia are classified as a noxious pest and may
  have exacerbated the mosquito problem in many areas by outcompeting native invertebrate predators of mosquito larvae.
  Several counties in California distribute mosquitofish at no charge to residents with manmade fish ponds and pools as
  part of their mosquito abatement programs. The fish are made available to residents only and are intended to be used
  solely on their own property, not introduced into natural habitat. On 24 February 2014, Chennai Corporation in India
  introduced western mosquitofish in 660 ponds to control the mosquito population in freshwater bodies.Fertilization is
  internal; the male secretes milt into the genital aperture of the female through his gonopodium. Within 16 to 28 days
  after mating, the female gives birth to about 60 young. The males reach sexual maturity within 43 to 62 days. The
  females, if born early in the reproductive season, reach sexual maturity within 21 to 28 days; females born later in
  the season reach sexual maturity in six to seven months.</p>
<p>The gene annotation process was carried out using a combination of protein-to-genome alignments, annotation mapping
  from a suitable reference species and RNA-seq alignments (where RNA-seq data with appropriate meta data were publicly
  available). For each candidate gene region, a selection process was applied to choose the most appropriate set of
  transcripts based on evolutionary distance, experimental evidence for the source data and quality of the alignments.
  Small ncRNAs were obtained using a combination of BLAST and Infernal/RNAfold. Pseudogenes were calculated by looking
  at genes with a large percentage of non-biological introns (introns of &lt;10bp), where the gene was covered in
  repeats, or where the gene was single exon and evidence of a functional multi-exon paralog was found elsewhere in the
  genome. lincRNAs were generated via RNA-seq data where no evidence of protein homology or protein domains could
  be found in the transcript.</p>
