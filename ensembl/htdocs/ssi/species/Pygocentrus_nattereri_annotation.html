<p>The red-bellied piranha, also known as the red piranha (Pygocentrus nattereri), is a species of piranha native to
  South America, found in the Amazon, Paraguay, Paran&aacute; and Essequibo basins, as well as coastal rivers of
  northeastern Brazil. This fish is locally abundant in its freshwater habitat. They are omnivorous foragers and feed
  on insects, worms, crustaceans and fish. They are not a migratory species, but do travel to seek out conditions
  conducive to breeding and spawning during periods of increased rainfall. Red-bellied piranhas often travel in shoals
  as a predatory defense, but rarely exhibit group hunting behavior. Acoustic communication is common, and is sometimes
  exhibited along with aggressive behaviors. Through media influence, the red-bellied piranha has developed a
  reputation as a ferocious predator, though this is not actually the case. They are a popular aquarium fish.</p>
<p>The gene annotation process was carried out using a combination of protein-to-genome alignments, annotation mapping
  from a suitable reference species and RNA-seq alignments (where RNA-seq data with appropriate meta data were publicly
  available). For each candidate gene region, a selection process was applied to choose the most appropriate set of
  transcripts based on evolutionary distance, experimental evidence for the source data and quality of the alignments.
  Small ncRNAs were obtained using a combination of BLAST and Infernal/RNAfold. Pseudogenes were calculated by looking
  at genes with a large percentage of non-biological introns (introns of &lt;10bp), where the gene was covered in
  repeats, or where the gene was single exon and evidence of a functional multi-exon paralog was found elsewhere in the
  genome. lincRNAs were generated via RNA-seq data where no evidence of protein homology or protein domains could
  be found in the transcript.</p>
