<p>The ASM325472v1 assembly was submitted by James Cook University on June 2018. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 3,121 contigs assembled into 2,444 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 5,390,770 while the scaffold N50 is 34,446,301.</p>
