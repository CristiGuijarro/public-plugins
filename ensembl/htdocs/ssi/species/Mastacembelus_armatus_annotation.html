<p>The tire track eel (Mastacembelus armatus) is a species of ray-finned, spiny eels belonging to the genus Mastacembelus (Scopoli, 1777) of the family Mastacembelidae, and is native to the riverine fauna of India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Viet Nam, Indonesia and other parts of South East Asia.  The species was named Mastacembelus armatus by Lacep&egrave;de in 1800. Other common names for this popular aquarium species are zigzag eel, spiny eel, leopard spiny eel and white-spotted spiny eel. This species is not only a popular aquarium fish but also as a food fish in its country of origin.</p>
<p>The gene annotation process was carried out using a combination of protein-to-genome alignments, annotation mapping from a suitable reference species and RNA-seq alignments (where RNA-seq data with appropriate meta data were publicly available). For each candidate gene region, a selection process was applied to choose the most appropriate set of transcripts based on evolutionary distance, experimental evidence for the source data and quality of the alignments.</br>Small ncRNAs were obtained using a combination of BLAST and Infernal/RNAfold.</br> Pseudogenes were calculated by looking at genes with a large percentage of non-biological introns (introns of &lt;10bp), where the gene was covered in repeats, or where the gene was single exon and evidence of a functional multi-exon paralog was found elsewhere in the genome.</br> lincRNAs were generated via RNA-seq data where no evidence of protein homology or protein domains could be found in the transcript.</p><p>In accordance with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lauderdale_Agreement">Fort Lauderdale Agreement </a>, please check the publication status of the genome/assembly before publishing any genome-wide analyses using these data.</p>
