<p>The Accipiter nisus_ver1.0 assembly was submitted by Environmental Genomics Office, Center for Enviromental Biology and Ecosystem Studies, National Institute for Environmental Studies on February 2019. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 105,361 contigs assembled into 44,975 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 35,336 while the scaffold N50 is 91,241.</p>
