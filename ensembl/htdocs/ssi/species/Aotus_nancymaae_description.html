<p>Nancy Ma's night monkey (<i>Aotus nancymaae</i>) is a night monkey species from South America. It is found in Brazil and Peru. It is known in medical research as a model organism for studying the Duffy antigen, located on the surface of red blood cells and encoded by the DARC gene.</p>
<p>The protein produced by this gene is a glycosylated membrane protein and a non-specific receptor for several chemokines. The protein is also the receptor for the human malarial parasites <i>Plasmodium vivax</i>, <i>Plasmodium knowlesi</i> and simian malarial parasite <i>Plasmodium cynomolgi</i>. Polymorphisms in this gene are the basis of the Duffy blood group system.</p>
