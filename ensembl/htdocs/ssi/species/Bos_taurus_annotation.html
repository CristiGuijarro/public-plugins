  Cattle &mdash;colloquially cows&mdash; are the most common type of large
  domesticated ungulates. They are a prominent modern member of the subfamily
  Bovinae, are the most widespread species of the genus Bos, and are most
  commonly classified collectively as Bos taurus.Cattle are commonly raised as
  livestock for meat (beef or veal, see beef cattle), for milk (see dairy
  cattle), and for hides, which are used to make leather. They are used as
  riding animals and draft animals (oxen or bullocks, which pull carts, plows
  and other implements). Another product of cattle is dung, which can be used to
  create manure or fuel. In some regions, such as parts of India, cattle have
  significant religious meaning. Cattle, mostly small breeds such as the
  Miniature Zebu, are kept as pets.Around 10,500 years ago, cattle were
  domesticated from as few as 80 progenitors in central Anatolia, the Levant and
  Western Iran. According to an estimate from 2011, there are 1.4 billion cattle
  in the world. In 2009, cattle became one of the first livestock animals to
  have a fully mapped genome. Some consider cattle the oldest form of wealth,
  and cattle raiding consequently one of the earliest forms of theft.

  The gene annotation process was carried out using a combination of
  protein-to-genome alignments, annotation mapping from a suitable reference
  species and RNA-seq alignments (where RNA-seq data with appropriate meta data
  were publicly available). For each candidate gene region, a selection process
  was applied to choose the most appropriate set of transcripts based on
  evolutionary distance, experimental evidence for the source data and quality
  of the alignments. Small ncRNAs were obtained using a combination of BLAST and
  Infernal/RNAfold. Pseudogenes were calculated by looking at genes with a large
  percentage of non-biological introns (introns of &lt;10bp), where the gene was
  covered in repeats, or where the gene was single exon and evidence of a
  functional multi-exon paralog was found elsewhere in the genome. lincRNAs were
  generated via RNA-seq data where no evidence of protein homology or protein
  domains could be found in the transcript.
