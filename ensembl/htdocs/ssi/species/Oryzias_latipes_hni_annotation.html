<p>The Japanese rice fish (Oryzias latipes) also known as the medaka, is a member of genus Oryzias (ricefish), the only
  genus in the subfamily Oryziinae. This small (up to about 3.6&nbsp;cm or 1.4&nbsp;in) native of East Asia is a
  denizen of rice paddies, marshes, ponds, slow-moving streams and tide pools. It is euryhaline, occurring in both
  brackish and freshwater. It became popular as an aquarium fish because of its hardiness and pleasant coloration: its
  coloration varies from creamy-white to yellowish in the wild to white, creamy-yellow, or orange in aquarium-bred
  individuals. Bright yellow, red or green transgenic populations, similar to GloFish, have also been developed, but
  are banned from sale in the EU. The medaka has been a popular pet since the 17th century in Japan. After
  fertilization, the female carries her eggs attached between her anal fins for a period before depositing them on
  plants or alike.</p>
<p>The gene annotation process was carried out using a combination of protein-to-genome alignments, annotation mapping
  from a suitable reference species and RNA-seq alignments (where RNA-seq data with appropriate meta data were publicly
  available). For each candidate gene region, a selection process was applied to choose the most appropriate set of
  transcripts based on evolutionary distance, experimental evidence for the source data and quality of the alignments.
  Small ncRNAs were obtained using a combination of BLAST and Infernal/RNAfold. Pseudogenes were calculated by looking
  at genes with a large percentage of non-biological introns (introns of &lt;10bp), where the gene was covered in
  repeats, or where the gene was single exon and evidence of a functional multi-exon paralog was found elsewhere in the
  genome. lincRNAs were generated via RNA-seq data where no evidence of protein homology or protein domains could
  be found in the transcript.</p>
