<p>The fMasArm1.1 assembly was submitted by SC on May 2018. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 359 contigs assembled into 126 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 8,014,513 while the scaffold N50 is 24,807,201.</p>
