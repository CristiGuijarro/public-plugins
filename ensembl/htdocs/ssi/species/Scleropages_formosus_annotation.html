<p>The Asian arowana (Scleropages formosus) comprises several phenotypic varieties of freshwater fish distributed
  geographically across Southeast Asia. While most consider the different varieties to belong to a single species, work
  by Pouyaud et al. (2003) differentiates these varieties into multiple species. They have several other common names,
  including Asian bonytongue, dragonfish, and a number of names specific to the different color varieties.Native to
  Southeast Asia, Asian arowanas inhabit blackwater rivers, slow-moving waters flowing through forested swamps and
  wetlands. Adults feed on other fish, while juveniles feed on insects.These popular aquarium fish have special
  cultural significance in areas influenced by Chinese culture. The name &#39;dragonfish&#39; stems from their
  resemblance to the Chinese dragon. This popularity has had both positive and negative effects on their status as
  endangered species.</p>
<p>The gene annotation process was carried out using a combination of protein-to-genome alignments, annotation mapping
  from a suitable reference species and RNA-seq alignments (where RNA-seq data with appropriate meta data were publicly
  available). For each candidate gene region, a selection process was applied to choose the most appropriate set of
  transcripts based on evolutionary distance, experimental evidence for the source data and quality of the alignments.
  Small ncRNAs were obtained using a combination of BLAST and Infernal/RNAfold. Pseudogenes were calculated by looking
  at genes with a large percentage of non-biological introns (introns of &lt;10bp), where the gene was covered in
  repeats, or where the gene was single exon and evidence of a functional multi-exon paralog was found elsewhere in the
  genome. lincRNAs were generated via RNA-seq data where no evidence of protein homology or protein domains could
  be found in the transcript.</p>
