<p>The ASM858656v1 assembly was submitted by Peking University on September 2019. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 98,653 contigs assembled into 68,189 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 28,180 while the scaffold N50 is 991,358.</p>
