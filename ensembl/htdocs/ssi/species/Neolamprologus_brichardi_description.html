<p>The lyretail cichlid (<i>Neolamprologus brichardi</i>) is a species of cichlid endemic to the alkaline waters of Lake Tanganyika in East Africa. It has been the subject of numerous studies on fish behaviour, as it is one of the few substrate-spawning cichlid that schools; it also utilizes a collective nursery for multi-generational rearing of fry.</p>
