<p>The IpCoco_1.2 assembly was submitted by Auburn University on June 2016. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 34,544 contigs assembled into 9,975 scaffolds. From these sequences, 29 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 77,201 while the scaffold N50 is 7,726,806.</p>
