<p><i>Stegastes partitus</i> or the bicolor damselfish is a species of bony fish in the family Pomacentridae found near the
  sea bed on shallow rocky and coral reefs in the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and off the coasts of Florida. Unlike most other members of the genus <i>Stegastes</i> which eat filamentous algae, the bicolor damselfish feeds on
  plankton.</p>
