<p>The AstBur1.0 assembly was submitted by Broad Institute on December 2011. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 69,074 contigs assembled into 8,001 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 21,886 while the scaffold N50 is 1,194,190.</p>
