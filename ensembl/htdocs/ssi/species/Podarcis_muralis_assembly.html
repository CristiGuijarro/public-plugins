<p>The PodMur_1.0 assembly was submitted by CIBIO-InBIO on March 2019. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 6,246 contigs assembled into 2,161 scaffolds. From these sequences, 19 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 714,612 while the scaffold N50 is 92,398,148.</p>
