<p>The Otsh_v1.0 assembly was submitted by Fisheries and Oceans Canada on January 2018. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 69,485 contigs assembled into 15,946 scaffolds. From these sequences, 34 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 133,169 while the scaffold N50 is 1,728,323.</p>
