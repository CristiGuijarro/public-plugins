<p>The mOrnAna1.p.v1 assembly was submitted by Vertebrate Genomes Project on May 2019. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 824 contigs assembled into 305 scaffolds. From these sequences, 31 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 15,146,802 while the scaffold N50 is 83,338,043.</p>
