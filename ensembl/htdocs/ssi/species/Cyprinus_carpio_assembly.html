<p>The common carp genome assembly was submitted by Chinese Academy Of Fishery Science on November 2016. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 53,088 contigs assembled into 9,378 scaffolds. From these sequences, 50 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 75,080 while the scaffold N50 is 7,828,959.</p>
