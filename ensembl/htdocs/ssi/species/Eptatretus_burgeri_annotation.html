<p>The gene annotation of the hagfish was created via a combination of RNA-seq based annotation of nine adult tissues, three development stages and one artificially merged set of all reads. This was combined with protein-to-genome alignments of a subset of vertebrate proteins. Cut-off parameters for the alignments were relaxed to account for the distant nature of hagfish to most other vertebrates. Small ncRNAs were obtained using a combination of BLAST and Infernal/RNAfold. lincRNAs were generated via RNA-seq data where no evidence of protein homology or protein domains could be found in the transcript.</p>
