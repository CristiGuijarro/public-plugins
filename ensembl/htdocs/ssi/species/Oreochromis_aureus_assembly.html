<p>The ASM587006v1 assembly was submitted by BGI-SZ ocean institute on May 2019. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 61,878 contigs assembled into 12,951 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 60,340 while the scaffold N50 is 1,102,239.</p>
