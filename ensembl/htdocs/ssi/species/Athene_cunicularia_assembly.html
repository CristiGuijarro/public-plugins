<p>The athCun1 assembly was submitted by Stefan Boerno's shared submissions on June 2018. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 34,182 contigs assembled into 445 scaffolds. From these sequences, 28 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 64,091 while the scaffold N50 is 42,147,404.</p>
