<p>The red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) is a tropical member of the family Phasianidae. It is the primary progenitor of
  the domestic chicken (though genetic evidence strongly suggests some past hybridisation with the grey junglefowl, as
  well). The red junglefowl was first domesticated at least 5000 years ago in Asia. Since then, it has spread around
  the world, and the domestic form is kept globally as a very productive food source of both meat and eggs.</p>
<p>The gene annotation process was carried out using a combination of protein-to-genome alignments, annotation mapping
  from a suitable reference species and RNA-seq alignments (where RNA-seq data with appropriate meta data were publicly
  available). For each candidate gene region, a selection process was applied to choose the most appropriate set of
  transcripts based on evolutionary distance, experimental evidence for the source data and quality of the alignments.
  Small ncRNAs were obtained using a combination of BLAST and Infernal/RNAfold. Pseudogenes were calculated by looking
  at genes with a large percentage of non-biological introns (introns of &lt;10bp), where the gene was covered in
  repeats, or where the gene was single exon and evidence of a functional multi-exon paralog was found elsewhere in the
  genome. lincRNAs were generated via RNA-seq data where no evidence of protein homology or protein domains could
  be found in the transcript.</p>
