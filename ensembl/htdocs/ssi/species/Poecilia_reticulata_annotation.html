<p>The guppy (Poecilia reticulata), also known as millionfish and rainbow fish, is one of the world&#39;s most widely
  distributed tropical fish, and one of the most popular freshwater aquarium fish species. It is a member of the family
  Poeciliidae and, like almost all American members of the family, is live-bearing. Guppies, whose natural range is in
  northeast South America, were introduced to many habitats and are now found all over the world. They are highly
  adaptable and thrive in many different environmental and ecological conditions. Male guppies, which are smaller than
  females, have ornamental caudal and dorsal fins. Wild guppies generally feed on a variety of food sources, including
  benthic algae and aquatic insect larvae. Guppies are used as a model organism in the fields of ecology, evolution,
  and behavioural studies.</p>
<p>The gene annotation process was carried out using a combination of protein-to-genome alignments, annotation mapping
  from a suitable reference species and RNA-seq alignments (where RNA-seq data with appropriate meta data were publicly
  available). For each candidate gene region, a selection process was applied to choose the most appropriate set of
  transcripts based on evolutionary distance, experimental evidence for the source data and quality of the alignments.
  Small ncRNAs were obtained using a combination of BLAST and Infernal/RNAfold. Pseudogenes were calculated by looking
  at genes with a large percentage of non-biological introns (introns of &lt;10bp), where the gene was covered in
  repeats, or where the gene was single exon and evidence of a functional multi-exon paralog was found elsewhere in the
  genome. lincRNAs were generated via RNA-seq data where no evidence of protein homology or protein domains could
  be found in the transcript.</p>
