<p>The ocellaris clownfish (Amphiprion ocellaris), also known as the false percula clownfish or common clownfish, is a
  marine fish belonging to the family Pomacentridae, which includes clownfishes and damselfishes. Amphiprion ocellaris
  are found in different colors, depending on where they are located. For example, black Amphiprion ocellaris with
  white bands can be found near northern Australia, Southeast Asia, and Japan. Orange or red-brown Amphiprion ocellaris
  also exist with three similar white bands on the body and head. Amphiprion ocellaris can be distinguished from other
  Amphriphon species based on the number of pectoral rays and dorsal spines. Amphiprion ocellaris are known to grow
  about 110&nbsp;mm long. Like many other fish species, females are, however, larger than males. The life cycle of
  Amphiprion ocellaris varies in whether they reside at the surface or bottom of the ocean. When they initially hatch,
  they reside near the surface. However, when Amphiprion ocellaris enter into the juvenile stage of life, they travel
  down to the bottom to find shelter in a host anemone. Once they find their anemone, they form a symbiotic
  relationship with them.</p>
<p>The gene annotation process was carried out using a combination of protein-to-genome alignments, annotation mapping
  from a suitable reference species and RNA-seq alignments (where RNA-seq data with appropriate meta data were publicly
  available). For each candidate gene region, a selection process was applied to choose the most appropriate set of
  transcripts based on evolutionary distance, experimental evidence for the source data and quality of the alignments.
  Small ncRNAs were obtained using a combination of BLAST and Infernal/RNAfold. Pseudogenes were calculated by looking
  at genes with a large percentage of non-biological introns (introns of &lt;10bp), where the gene was covered in
  repeats, or where the gene was single exon and evidence of a functional multi-exon paralog was found elsewhere in the
  genome. lincRNAs were generated via RNA-seq data where no evidence of protein homology or protein domains could
  be found in the transcript.</p>
