<p>The mangrove killifish or mangrove rivulus (<i>Kryptolebias marmoratus</i>) is a species of fish found in brackish and marine waters (less frequently in fresh water) along the eastern coast of America from Florida to Brazil. It has a very wide tolerance of both salinity and temperature, can survive for about two months on land, and mostly breeds by self-fertilization.</p>
