<p>The fTakRub1.2 assembly was submitted by SC on June 2019. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 530 contigs assembled into 128 scaffolds. From these sequences, 22 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 3,136,617 while the scaffold N50 is 16,705,553.</p>
