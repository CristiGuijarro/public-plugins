<p>The FUGU5 assembly was submitted by The Fugu Genome Sequencing Consortium on October 2011. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 30,861 contigs assembled into 7,091 scaffolds. From these sequences, 22 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 52,883 while the scaffold N50 is 928,938.</p>
