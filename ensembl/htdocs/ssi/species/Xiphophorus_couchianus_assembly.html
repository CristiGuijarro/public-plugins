<p>The Xiphophorus_couchianus-4.0.1 assembly was submitted by McDonnell Genome Institute - Washington University School of Medicine on November 2015. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 74,316 contigs assembled into 25 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 14,608 while the scaffold N50 is 29,398,440.</p>
