<p>The sooty mangabey (<i>Cercocebus atys</i>) is an Old World monkey found in forests from Senegal in a margin along the coast down to Ghana. Sooty mangabeys are naturally infected with a strain of Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV), known as SIVsmm. Due to extensive human-mangabey contact in sub-Saharan Africa, SIVsmm has jumped from this species into humans on many occasions, resulting in HIV-2 virus (the HIV-1 strain by contrast came from the common chimpanzee strain of SIV).</p>
