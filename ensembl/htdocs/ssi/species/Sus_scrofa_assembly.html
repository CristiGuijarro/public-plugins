The Sscrofa11.1 assembly of the pig genome was produced in January 2017 by the Swine Genome Sequencing Consortium (SGSC). It consists of 20 chromosomes (1-18, X and Y) and 583 unplaced scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 48,231,277 while the scaffold N50 is 88,231,837. The pig genome sequence has been release under the term of the Toronto Statement (Nature 2009, 461: 168).
