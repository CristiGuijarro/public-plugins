<p>The horse (<i>Equus caballus</i>) is an odd-toed ungulate mammal belonging to the taxonomic family Equidae. It has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, <i>Eohippus</i>, into the large, single-toed animal of today.</p>
<p>Humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BC, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC. So-called "wild horses" are usually feral populations descended from domesticated <i>E. caballus</i>; true wild horses such as Przewalski's horse and the now-extinct tarpan are generally considered to be separate <i>Equus</i> species.</p>
