<p>The MUSP714 assembly was submitted by Oklahoma State Universtiy on July 2018. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 161,217 contigs assembled into 37,536 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 30,918 while the scaffold N50 is 2,198,966.</p>
