<p>The Hebao_red_carp_1.0 assembly was submitted by Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences on January 2019. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 316,365 contigs assembled into 260,608 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 36,306 while the scaffold N50 is 898,640.</p>
