<p>The Felis_catus_9.0 assembly was submitted by Genome Sequencing Center (GSC) at Washington University (WashU) School of Medicine on November 2017. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 4,909 contigs assembled into 4,525 scaffolds. From these sequences, 19 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 41,915,695 while the scaffold N50 is 83,967,707.</p>
