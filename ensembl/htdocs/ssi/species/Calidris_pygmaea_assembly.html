<p>The ASM369795v1 assembly was submitted by Adam Mickiewicz University on October 2018. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 44,336 contigs assembled into 29,819 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 189,165 while the scaffold N50 is 3,136,279.</p>
