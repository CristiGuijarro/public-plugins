<p>The CroPor_comp1 assembly was submitted by Mississippi State University on September 2016. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 97,109 contigs assembled into 70 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 34,073 while the scaffold N50 is 84,437,661.</p>
