<p>The fAnaTes1.1 assembly was submitted by SC on May 2018. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 362 contigs assembled into 70 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 7,055,436 while the scaffold N50 is 26,090,302.</p>
