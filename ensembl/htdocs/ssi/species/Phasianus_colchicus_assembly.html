<p>The ASM414374v1 assembly was submitted by Shenzhen University on February 2019. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 58,369 contigs assembled into 39,677 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 197,843 while the scaffold N50 is 10,682,894.</p>
