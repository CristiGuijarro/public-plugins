<p>The Cse_v1.0 assembly was submitted by Beijing Genomics Institute on January 2014. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 62,912 contigs assembled into 31,181 scaffolds. From these sequences, 22 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 27,008 while the scaffold N50 is 509,861.</p>
