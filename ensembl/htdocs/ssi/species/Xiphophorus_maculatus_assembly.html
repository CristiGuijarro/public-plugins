<p>The X_maculatus-5.0-male assembly was submitted by The Genome Institute, Washington University at St. Louis on December 2017. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 258 contigs assembled into 102 scaffolds. From these sequences, 24 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 9,181,372 while the scaffold N50 is 31,535,491.</p>
