<p>The ASM164957v1 assembly was submitted by Sungkyunkwan University on May 2016. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 26,350 contigs assembled into 3,073 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 57,884 while the scaffold N50 is 2,229,659.</p>
