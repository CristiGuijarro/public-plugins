<p>The GooseV1.0 assembly was submitted by Poultry Science Institute on June 2017. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 64,862 contigs assembled into 1,801 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 35,039 while the scaffold N50 is 5,027,881.</p>
