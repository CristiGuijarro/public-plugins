<p>The HU_Pman_2.1 assembly was submitted by Harvard University / Howard Hughes Medical Institute on November 2018. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 155,965 contigs assembled into 8,523 scaffolds. From these sequences, 24 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 30,111 while the scaffold N50 is 115,033,041.</p>
