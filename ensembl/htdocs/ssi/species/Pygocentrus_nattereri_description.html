<p>The red-bellied piranha (<i>Pygocentrus nattereri</i>) is a species of piranha native to
  South America, found in the Amazon, Paraguay, Paran&aacute; and Essequibo basins, as well as coastal rivers of
  northeastern Brazil.
  Despite the piranhaâ€™s reputation as a dangerous carnivore, it is primarily a scavenger and forager, and will mainly eat plants and insects during the rainy season when food is abundant.</p>
