<p>The ASM309773v1 assembly was submitted by University of Georgia on May 2018. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 73,682 contigs assembled into 2,943 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 17,511 while the scaffold N50 is 6,651,460.</p>
