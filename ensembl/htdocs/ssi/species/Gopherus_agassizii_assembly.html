<p>The ASM289641v1 assembly was submitted by Arizona State University on January 2018. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 255,430 contigs assembled into 172,559 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 43,735 while the scaffold N50 is 228,109.</p>
