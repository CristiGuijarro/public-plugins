<p>The Callorhinchus_milii-6.1.3 assembly was submitted by Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Singapore on December 2013. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 67,421 contigs assembled into 21,204 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 46,577 while the scaffold N50 is 4,521,921.</p>
