<p>The SCA1 assembly was submitted by Mpi Molgen on February 2014. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 358,420 contigs assembled into 304,400 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 53,884 while the scaffold N50 is 17,815,079.</p>
