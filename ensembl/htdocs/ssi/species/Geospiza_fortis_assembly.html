<p>The GeoFor_1.0 assembly was submitted by Beijing Genomics Institute on July 2012. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 95,828 contigs assembled into 27,239 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 30,521 while the scaffold N50 is 5,255,844.</p>
