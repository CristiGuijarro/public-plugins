<p>The orange clownfish (<i>Amphiprion percula</i>) is widely known as a popular aquarium fish. Like other clownfishes it often lives in symbiotic association with sea anemones; <i>A. percula</i> is associated specifically with <i>Heteractis magnifica</i> and <i>Stichodactyla gigantea</i>, and in its larval form uses chemical cues released by the anemone to identify and locate the appropriate host species.</p> 
<p>The anemone helps the fish by giving it protection from predators, which include brittle stars, wrasses, and other damselfish, and the fish helps the anemone by feeding it, increasing oxygenation, and removing waste material from the host. The fish's ability to live within the anemone without being harmed has been shown to derive from a combination of two factors: immunity to the anemone's toxins, and secretion of a mucus that prevents the anemone from discharging its nematocysts.</p>
