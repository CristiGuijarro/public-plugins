<p>The ASM318616v1 assembly was submitted by CNAG on June 2018. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 21,326 contigs assembled into 22 scaffolds. From these sequences, 22 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 54,836 while the scaffold N50 is 24,811,384.</p>
