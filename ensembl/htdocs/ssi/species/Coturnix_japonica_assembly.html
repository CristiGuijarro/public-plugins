<p>The Coturnix japonica 2.0 assembly was submitted by McDonnell Genome Institute - Washington University School of Medicine on March 2016. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 9,642 contigs assembled into 2,531 scaffolds. From these sequences, 32 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 511,217 while the scaffold N50 is 2,975,000.</p>
