<p>The ASM223469v1 assembly was submitted by The University of Tokyo on July 2017. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 342 contigs assembled into 24 scaffolds. From these sequences, 24 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 3,516,609 while the scaffold N50 is 32,853,055.</p>
