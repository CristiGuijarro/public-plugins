<p>The Lepidothrix_coronata-1.0 assembly was submitted by McDonnell Genome Institute on March 2016. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 23,501 contigs assembled into 4,612 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 141,849 while the scaffold N50 is 4,972,619.</p>
