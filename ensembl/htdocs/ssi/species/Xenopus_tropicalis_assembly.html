<p>The Xenopus_tropicalis_v9.1 assembly was submitted by DOE Joint Genome Institute on July 2016. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 61,330 contigs assembled into 6,822 scaffolds. From these sequences, 10 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 71,041 while the scaffold N50 is 135,134,832.</p>
