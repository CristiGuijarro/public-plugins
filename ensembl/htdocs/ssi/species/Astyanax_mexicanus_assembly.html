<p>The Astyanax_mexicanus-2.0 assembly was submitted by Washington University School of Medince on September 2017. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 3,030 contigs assembled into 2,415 scaffolds. From these sequences, 25 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 1,767,240 while the scaffold N50 is 35,377,769.</p>
