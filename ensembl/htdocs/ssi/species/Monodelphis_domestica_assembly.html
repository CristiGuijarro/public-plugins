<p>The ASM229v1 assembly was submitted by The Genome Sequencing Platform, The Genome Assembly Team on May 2011. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 72,811 contigs assembled into 5,137 scaffolds. From these sequences, 9 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 107,990 while the scaffold N50 is 527,952,102.</p>
