<p>Tuatara are reptiles endemic to New Zealand. Although resembling lizards they are part of a distinct lineage,
  the order Rhynchocephalia, which flourished around 200 million years
  ago. Their most recent common ancestor with any other extant group is with the squamates (lizards and snakes). For
  this reason, tuatara are of interest in the study of the evolution of lizards and snakes, and for the reconstruction
  of the appearance and habits of the earliest diapsids, a group of amniote tetrapods that also includes dinosaurs,
  birds and crocodilians.</p>
