<p>The latLat_1.0 assembly was submitted by Kyoto University on February 2019. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 89,677 contigs assembled into 83,587 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 35,581 while the scaffold N50 is 39,330.</p>
