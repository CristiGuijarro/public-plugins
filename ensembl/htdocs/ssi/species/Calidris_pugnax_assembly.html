<p>The ASM143184v1 assembly was submitted by BGI on November 2015. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 34,157 contigs assembled into 3,753 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 109,237 while the scaffold N50 is 10,060,041.</p>
