<p>The Tgel_1.0 assembly was submitted by Kenneth Chiou's shared submissions on June 2018. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 35,108 contigs assembled into 15,308 scaffolds. From these sequences, 22 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 310,061 while the scaffold N50 is 130,230,028.</p>
