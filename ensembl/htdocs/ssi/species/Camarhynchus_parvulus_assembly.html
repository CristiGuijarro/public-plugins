<p>The STF_HiC assembly was submitted by Uppsala Univeristy on September 2019. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 1,530 contigs assembled into 1,345 scaffolds. From these sequences, 31 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 16,035,651 while the scaffold N50 is 70,356,807.</p>
