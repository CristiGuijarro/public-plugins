<p>The Philippine tarsier (<i>Carlito syrichta</i>) is a haplorrhine primate of the family Tarsiidae, which is the lone extant family within the infraorder Tarsiiformes. Although the group was once more widespread, all its species living today are found in the islands of Southeast Asia. The <i>C. syrichta</i> population has declined severely since the 1960s owing to forest clearance.</p>
