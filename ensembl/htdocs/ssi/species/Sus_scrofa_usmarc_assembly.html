<p>The USMARCv1.0 assembly was submitted by Usda Ars on December 2017. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 14,818 contigs assembled into 14,157 scaffolds. From these sequences, 20 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 6,372,407 while the scaffold N50 is 131,458,098.
