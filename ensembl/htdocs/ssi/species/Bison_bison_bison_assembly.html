<p>The Bison_UMD1.0 assembly was submitted by University of Maryland on October 2014. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 470,415 contigs assembled into 128,431 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 19,971 while the scaffold N50 is 7,192,658.</p>
