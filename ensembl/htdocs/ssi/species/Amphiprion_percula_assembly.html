<p>The Nemo_v1 assembly was submitted by King Abdullah University of Science and Technology on April 2018. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 1,047 contigs assembled into 365 scaffolds. From these sequences, 24 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 3,123,421 while the scaffold N50 is 38,416,550.</p>
