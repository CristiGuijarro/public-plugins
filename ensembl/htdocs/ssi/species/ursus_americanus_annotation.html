<p>The American black bear (Ursus americanus) is a medium-sized bear native to North America. It is the continent&#39;s
  smallest and most widely distributed bear species. Black bears are omnivores, with their diets varying greatly
  depending on season and location. They typically live in largely forested areas, but do leave forests in search of
  food. Sometimes they become attracted to human communities because of the immediate availability of food. The
  American black bear is the world&#39;s most common bear species.It is listed by the International Union for
  Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as a least-concern species, due to its widespread distribution and a large population
  estimated to be twice that of all other bear species combined. Along with the brown bear, it is one of only two of
  the eight modern bear species not considered globally threatened with extinction by the IUCN. American black bears
  often mark trees using their teeth and claws as a form of communication with other bears, a behavior common to many
  species of bears.</p>
<p>The gene annotation process was carried out using a combination of protein-to-genome alignments, annotation mapping
  from a suitable reference species and RNA-seq alignments (where RNA-seq data with appropriate meta data were publicly
  available). For each candidate gene region, a selection process was applied to choose the most appropriate set of
  transcripts based on evolutionary distance, experimental evidence for the source data and quality of the alignments.
  Small ncRNAs were obtained using a combination of BLAST and Infernal/RNAfold. Pseudogenes were calculated by looking
  at genes with a large percentage of non-biological introns (introns of &lt;10bp), where the gene was covered in
  repeats, or where the gene was single exon and evidence of a functional multi-exon paralog was found elsewhere in the
  genome. lincRNAs were generated via RNA-seq data where no evidence of protein homology or protein domains could
  be found in the transcript.</p>
