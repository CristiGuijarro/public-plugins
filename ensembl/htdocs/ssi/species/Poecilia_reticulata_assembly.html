<p>The Guppy_female_1.0+MT assembly was submitted by Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology on May 2014. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 40,144 contigs assembled into 3,029 scaffolds. From these sequences, 23 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 41,908 while the scaffold N50 is 5,270,359.</p>
