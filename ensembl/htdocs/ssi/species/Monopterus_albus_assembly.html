<p>The M_albus_1.0 assembly was submitted by Wuhan University on January 2017. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 71,879 contigs assembled into 20,622 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 22,239 while the scaffold N50 is 2,106,322.</p>
