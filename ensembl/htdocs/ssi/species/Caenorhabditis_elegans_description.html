<p><i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> is a free-living, transparent nematode, about 1 mm in length, that lives in temperate soil environments. In 1974, Sydney Brenner began research into the molecular and developmental biology of <i>C. elegans</i>, which has since been extensively used as a model organism, being the first multicellular species to have its whole genome sequenced.</p>
