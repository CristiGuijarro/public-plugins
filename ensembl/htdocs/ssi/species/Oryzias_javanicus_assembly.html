<p>The OJAV_1.1 assembly was submitted by INRA (Fish Physiology and Genomics laboratory) on January 2019. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 751 contigs assembled into 254 scaffolds. From these sequences, 24 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 3,558,013 while the scaffold N50 is 35,390,520.</p>
