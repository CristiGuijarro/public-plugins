<p>The ASM336829v1 assembly was submitted by National Institutes of Health on August 2018. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 8,463 contigs assembled into 6,216 scaffolds. From these sequences, 59 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 821,153 while the scaffold N50 is 22,763,433.</p>
