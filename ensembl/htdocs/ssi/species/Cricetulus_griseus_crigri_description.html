<p>The Chinese hamster (<i>Cricetulus griseus</i>), is a species of hamster originating from the deserts of northern China and Mongolia. In the past, Chinese hamsters were commonly used laboratory animals, until they were replaced by the common mouse and rat, which are easier to keep and breed. The CHO cell line was derived from the ovary of this species and is used in studies of genetics, toxicity screening, nutrition and gene expression, particularly to express recombinant proteins.</p>
