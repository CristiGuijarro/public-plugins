<p>The ASM283717v2 assembly was submitted by BGI on March 2019. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 143,605 contigs assembled into 14,677 scaffolds. From these sequences, 21 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 42,542 while the scaffold N50 is 122,182,240.</p>
