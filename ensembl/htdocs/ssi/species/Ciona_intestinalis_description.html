<p><i>Ciona intestinalis</i> (sometimes known by the common name of vase tunicate) is an ascidian (sea squirt), and one of the closest invertebrate relatives of vertebrates. It is used as a model invertebrate chordate in developmental biology and genomics; its genome is the smallest of any experimentally manipulable chordate, and thus provides a good system for exploring vertebrate evolutionary origins.</p>
