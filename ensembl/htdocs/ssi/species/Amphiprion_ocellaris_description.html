<p>The clown anemonefish (<i>Amphiprion ocellaris</i>), also known as the false percula clownfish or common clownfish, is a marine fish belonging to the family Pomacentridae, which includes clownfishes and damselfishes. <i> A. ocellaris</i> is the most basal species in the genus Amphiprion which is closely related to the genus <i>Premnas</i>. The species' most closely related ancestor is <i>Amphiprion percula</i>, the Orange clownfish. It is thought that <i>A. ocellaris</i> specialized after diverging from the genus <i>Premnas</i>, and scientific evidence confirms that all clownfish belonging to the genus <i>Amphiprion</i> initially could withstand the stings of only one type of anemone; after further speciation the 28 different species of clownfish including <i>A. ocellaris</i> have specialized to be able to resist the poisonous stings of many different anemone species.
