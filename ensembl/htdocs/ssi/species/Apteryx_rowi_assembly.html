<p>The aptRow1 assembly was submitted by Harvard University on July 2018. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 24,593 contigs assembled into 4,120 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 129,376 while the scaffold N50 is 1,672,276.</p>
