<p>The BosGru_v2.0 assembly was submitted by BGI-shenzhen on January 2013. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 233,198 contigs assembled into 41,192 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 22,822 while the scaffold N50 is 1,407,960.</p>
