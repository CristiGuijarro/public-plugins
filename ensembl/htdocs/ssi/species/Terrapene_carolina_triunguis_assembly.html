<p>The T_m_triunguis-2.0 assembly was submitted by McDonnell Genome Institute - Washington University School of Medicine on September 2018. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 106,051 contigs assembled into 52,260 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 76,614 while the scaffold N50 is 24,249,581.</p>
