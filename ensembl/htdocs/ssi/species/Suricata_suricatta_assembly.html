<p>The meerkat_22Aug2017_6uvM2_HiC assembly was submitted by DNA Zoo on July 2019. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 129,036 contigs assembled into 63,791 scaffolds. From these sequences, 18 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 75,409 while the scaffold N50 is 141,453,419.</p>
