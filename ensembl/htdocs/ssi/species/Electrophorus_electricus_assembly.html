<p>The Ee_SOAP_WITH_SSPACE assembly was submitted by University of Wisconsin Madison on October 2018. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 47,652 contigs assembled into 8,786 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 37,141 while the scaffold N50 is 613,956.</p>
