<p>The LonStrDom1 assembly was submitted by HHMI/UCSF on June 2017. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 33,369 contigs assembled into 3,014 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 100,439 while the scaffold N50 is 2,953,339.</p>
