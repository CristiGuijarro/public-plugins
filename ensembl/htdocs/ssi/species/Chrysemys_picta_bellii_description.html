<p>The painted turtle (<i>Chrysemys picta</i>) lives in slow-moving fresh waters from southern Canada to Louisiana and northern Mexico, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific. It is the only species of the genus <i>Chrysemys</i>, which is part of the pond turtle family Emydidae.</p>
<p>While habitat loss and road killings have reduced the turtle's population, its ability to live in human-disturbed settings has helped it remain the most abundant turtle in North America. Adults in the wild can live for more than 55 years.</p>
