<p>The Monterrey platyfish (Xiphophorus couchianus) is a species of freshwater fish in family Poecilidae of order
  Cyprinodontiformes. A live-bearer, it is native to the vicinity of Monterrey, Mexico.IUCN lists the Monterrey
  platyfish, formerly widespread in Mexico, as Critically Endangered, upgraded from Endangered in 1996. The fish&#39;s
  population, numbering fewer than 250 individuals, is falling rapidly and is confined to a very small area, occurring
  only in fragmented pockets of habitat populated by few individuals. It is additionally suffering from environmental
  degradation.X. couchianus is harvested for the aquarium fish trade. It has also been used for genetic research.Sexual
  dimorphism is moderate, the male Monterrey platyfish growing to a maximum overall length of 4.0&nbsp;cm (1.6&nbsp;in)
  and the female 6.0&nbsp;cm (2.4&nbsp;in).</p>
<p>The gene annotation process was carried out using a combination of protein-to-genome alignments, annotation mapping
  from a suitable reference species and RNA-seq alignments (where RNA-seq data with appropriate meta data were publicly
  available). For each candidate gene region, a selection process was applied to choose the most appropriate set of
  transcripts based on evolutionary distance, experimental evidence for the source data and quality of the alignments.
  Small ncRNAs were obtained using a combination of BLAST and Infernal/RNAfold. Pseudogenes were calculated by looking
  at genes with a large percentage of non-biological introns (introns of &lt;10bp), where the gene was covered in
  repeats, or where the gene was single exon and evidence of a functional multi-exon paralog was found elsewhere in the
  genome. lincRNAs were generated via RNA-seq data where no evidence of protein homology or protein domains could
  be found in the transcript.</p>
