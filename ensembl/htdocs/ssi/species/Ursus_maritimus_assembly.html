<p>The UrsMar_1.0 assembly was submitted by BGI-Shenzhen on May 2014. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 134,162 contigs assembled into 23,819 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 46,506 while the scaffold N50 is 15,940,661.</p>
