<p>Neolamprologus brichardi is a species of cichlid endemic to the alkaline waters of Lake Tanganyika in East Africa.
  It is a popular aquarium fish kept in the fishkeeping hobby, where it is known under a variety of common names
  including Princess cichlid, Princess of Burundi, Lyretail cichlid, Fairy cichlid and Brichard&#39;s lamprologus. In
  addition, the species is also the subject of numerous studies on fish behaviour. It is closely related to N. pulcher
  from the southern half of Lake Tanganyika (N. brichardi is more widespread) and some have recommended merging the two
  into a single species.N. brichardi is notable in a number of ways. This fish is a substrate spawner (lays eggs on
  substrate), utilizing the rocky rubble to do so. It is one of the few substrate-spawning cichlid that also schools.
  It is not unheard of to find a school numbering near 100,000 individuals within a 50 m square area. It is one of the
  few fish in Africa that utilizes a collective nursery. This means that adults, sub-adults, and even half-grown fry
  all participate in a multi-generational rearing of the fry. N. brichardi individuals not only care for their own fry
  but also the fry of those around them, all while keeping vigil over other adults still actively spawning. This is
  similar to the cooperative breeding system of a related species of cichlid, N. pulcher, in that N. pulcher
  individuals will care for the offspring of others.N. brichardi specializes on feeding from the rocky biocover,
  picking at small crustaceans and invertebrates. It will also feed on swarms of plankton when available.</p>
<p>The gene annotation process was carried out using a combination of protein-to-genome alignments, annotation mapping
  from a suitable reference species and RNA-seq alignments (where RNA-seq data with appropriate meta data were publicly
  available). For each candidate gene region, a selection process was applied to choose the most appropriate set of
  transcripts based on evolutionary distance, experimental evidence for the source data and quality of the alignments.
  Small ncRNAs were obtained using a combination of BLAST and Infernal/RNAfold. Pseudogenes were calculated by looking
  at genes with a large percentage of non-biological introns (introns of &lt;10bp), where the gene was covered in
  repeats, or where the gene was single exon and evidence of a functional multi-exon paralog was found elsewhere in the
  genome. lincRNAs were generated via RNA-seq data where no evidence of protein homology or protein domains could
  be found in the transcript.</p>
