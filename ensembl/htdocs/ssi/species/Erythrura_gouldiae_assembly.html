<p>The GouldianFinch assembly was submitted by CIBIO/InBIO Research Center in Biodiversity and Genetic Resources on October 2018. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 39,605 contigs assembled into 18,372 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 137,954 while the scaffold N50 is 17,126,938.</p>
