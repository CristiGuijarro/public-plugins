<p>The AmpOce1.0 assembly was submitted by Deakin University on November 2017. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 7,803 contigs assembled into 6,405 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 324,210 while the scaffold N50 is 401,715.</p>
