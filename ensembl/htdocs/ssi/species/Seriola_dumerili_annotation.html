<p>The greater amberjack (Seriola dumerili) is a jack of the genus Seriola. It is found in the Mediterranean Sea, the Atlantic Ocean, the Pacific Ocean and the Indian coasts, living usually between 20 and 70&nbsp;m of depth (with a maximum of 360&nbsp;m). It is the largest genus in the family Carangidae, with a maximum length of 200&nbsp;cm.
It is a fast-swimming pelagic fish with similar habits to the kingfish. They are silver-blue with a golden side line, with a brown band crossing over the eye area.The greater amberjack is a powerful hunter which feeds on other fish and invertebrates.The greater amberjack is prized by sport fisherman because it is a very powerful fish and can be quite large, even as much as 70&nbsp;kg. It is an excellent eating fish. It is also a big-game fish and are one of the greatest fighting fish pound for pound.</p>
<p>The gene annotation process was carried out using a combination of protein-to-genome alignments, annotation mapping from a suitable reference species and RNA-seq alignments (where RNA-seq data with appropriate meta data were publicly available). For each candidate gene region, a selection process was applied to choose the most appropriate set of transcripts based on evolutionary distance, experimental evidence for the source data and quality of the alignments.</br>Small ncRNAs were obtained using a combination of BLAST and Infernal/RNAfold.</br> Pseudogenes were calculated by looking at genes with a large percentage of non-biological introns (introns of &lt;10bp), where the gene was covered in repeats, or where the gene was single exon and evidence of a functional multi-exon paralog was found elsewhere in the genome.</br> lincRNAs were generated via RNA-seq data where no evidence of protein homology or protein domains could be found in the transcript.</p><p>In accordance with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lauderdale_Agreement">Fort Lauderdale Agreement </a>, please check the publication status of the genome/assembly before publishing any genome-wide analyses using these data.</p>
