<p>The naked mole-rat (<i>Heterocephalus glaber</i>), also known as the sand puppy or desert mole rat, is a burrowing rodent native to parts of East Africa. It is a eusocial mammal with a highly unusual set of physical traits that enable it to thrive in an otherwise harsh underground environment; it is the only mammalian thermoconformer, almost entirely ectothermic (cold-blooded) in how it regulates body temperature.</p>
