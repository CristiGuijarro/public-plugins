<p>The fSalaFa1.1 assembly was submitted by SC on July 2019. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 805 contigs assembled into 203 scaffolds. From these sequences, 22 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 2,597,836 while the scaffold N50 is 32,729,575.</p>
