<p>The NNQGG.v01 assembly was submitted by Center for Quantitative Genetics and Genomics on January 2018. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 143,887 contigs assembled into 7,175 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 32,336 while the scaffold N50 is 6,814,223.</p>
