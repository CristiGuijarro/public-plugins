<p>The VulVul2.2 assembly was submitted by University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign on May 2018. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 183,898 contigs assembled into 82,424 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 55,450 while the scaffold N50 is 12,472,085.</p>
