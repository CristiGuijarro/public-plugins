<p>The ASM874695v1 assembly was submitted by China Agricultural University on October 2019. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 1,974 contigs assembled into 1,665 scaffolds. From these sequences, 41 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 11,467,013 while the scaffold N50 is 77,626,585.</p>
