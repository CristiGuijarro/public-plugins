<p>Stegastes partitus or the bicolor damselfish is a species of bony fish in the family Pomacentridae found near the sea bed on shallow rocky and coral reefs in the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and off the coasts of Florida.The bicolor damselfish can grow to about 10&nbsp;cm (3.9&nbsp;in). The head and the front half of the body are dark grey or black and the rear half is pale, usually with some yellow, with regional variations in the coloring. The large dorsal fin has 12 spines and 14-17 soft rays. The anal fin is also large and has two spines and 13-15 soft rays.Unlike most other members of the genus Stegastes which eat filamentous algae, the bicolor damselfish feeds on plankton. It forms loose groups of up to twenty individuals and defends a territory over a rocky reef with plenty of crevices in which to lurk.</p>
<p>The gene annotation process was carried out using a combination of protein-to-genome alignments, annotation mapping from a suitable reference species and RNA-seq alignments (where RNA-seq data with appropriate meta data were publicly available). For each candidate gene region, a selection process was applied to choose the most appropriate set of transcripts based on evolutionary distance, experimental evidence for the source data and quality of the alignments.</br>Small ncRNAs were obtained using a combination of BLAST and Infernal/RNAfold.</br> Pseudogenes were calculated by looking at genes with a large percentage of non-biological introns (introns of &lt;10bp), where the gene was covered in repeats, or where the gene was single exon and evidence of a functional multi-exon paralog was found elsewhere in the genome.</br> lincRNAs were generated via RNA-seq data where no evidence of protein homology or protein domains could be found in the transcript.</p><p>In accordance with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lauderdale_Agreement">Fort Lauderdale Agreement </a>, please check the publication status of the genome/assembly before publishing any genome-wide analyses using these data.</p>
