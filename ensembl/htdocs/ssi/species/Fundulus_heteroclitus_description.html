<p>The mummichog (<i>Fundulus heteroclitus</i>) is a small killifish found along the Atlantic coast of the United States and Canada. The species is noted for its hardiness and ability to tolerate highly variable salinity, temperature fluctuations from 6 to 35&nbsp;&deg;C (43 to 95&nbsp;&deg;F), very low oxygen levels and heavily polluted ecosystems. As a result, the mummichog is a popular research subject in embryological, physiological, and toxicological studies. It is also the first fish ever sent to space, aboard Skylab in 1973.</p>
