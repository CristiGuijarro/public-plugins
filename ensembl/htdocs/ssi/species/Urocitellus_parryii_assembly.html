<p>The ASM342692v1 assembly was submitted by UAF on August 2018. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 79,883 contigs assembled into 15,884 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 91,013 while the scaffold N50 is 3,964,291.</p>
