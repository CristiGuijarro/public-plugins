<p>The Chrysemys_picta_bellii-3.0.3 assembly was submitted by Painted turtle genome sequencing consortium on March 2014. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 262,326 contigs assembled into 78,631 scaffolds. From these sequences, 18 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 21,349 while the scaffold N50 is 6,605,846.</p>
