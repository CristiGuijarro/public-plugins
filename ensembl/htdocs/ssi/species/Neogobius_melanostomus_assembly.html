<p>The RGoby_Basel_V2 assembly was submitted by University of Basel on July 2019. The assembly is on contig level, consisting of 1,364 contigs assembled into 1,364 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 2,817,412 while the scaffold N50 is 2,817,412.</p>
