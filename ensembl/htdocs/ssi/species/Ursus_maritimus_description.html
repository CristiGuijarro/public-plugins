<p>The polar bear (Ursus maritimus) is a hypercarnivorous bear whose native range lies largely within the Arctic
  Circle, encompassing the Arctic Ocean, its surrounding seas and surrounding land masses. 
  Although it is the sister species of the brown bear, it has evolved to occupy a narrower ecological niche, with many body
  characteristics adapted for cold temperatures, for moving across snow, ice and open water, and for hunting seals,
  which make up most of its diet.</p>
