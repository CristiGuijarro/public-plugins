<p>The bare-nosed wombat genome assembly assembly was submitted by MRC Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh on December 2018. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 81,204 contigs assembled into 15,416 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 113,054 while the scaffold N50 is 28,503,419.</p>
