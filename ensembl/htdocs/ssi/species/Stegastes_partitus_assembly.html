<p>The Stegastes_partitus-1.0.2 assembly was submitted by Aquatic Genome Models on May 2014. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 42,060 contigs assembled into 5,818 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 43,010 while the scaffold N50 is 411,659.</p>
