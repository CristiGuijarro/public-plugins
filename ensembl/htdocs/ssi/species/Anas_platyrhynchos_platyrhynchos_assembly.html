<p>The CAU_duck1.0 assembly was submitted by China Agricultural University on November 2017. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 44,791 contigs assembled into 21,240 scaffolds. From these sequences, 29 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 88,037 while the scaffold N50 is 74,988,519.</p>
