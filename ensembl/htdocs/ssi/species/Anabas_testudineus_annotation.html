<p>Anabas testudineus, the climbing perch, is a species of fish in the family Anabantidae, the climbing gouramis. It is native to Asia, where it occurs from India east to China and to the Wallace Line. It is an invasive species that can live without water for 6 days. It is believed that the fish may be invading new territories by slipping aboard fishing boats.It has also been established in some countries outside of its native range, in eastern Indonesia and Papua New Guinea.  It is believed to be advancing towards Australia.  In late 2005, the fish was discovered on Saibai Island and another small Australian island in the Torres Strait north of Queensland, about three to four miles south of Papua New Guinea.This species grows to 25&nbsp;cm (9.8&nbsp;in) in total length.It is likely that this is a species complex, with the name Anabas testudineus applied to what are actually several different species. With further study, populations of this fish may be divided up into separate species and given new names.</p>
<p>The gene annotation process was carried out using a combination of protein-to-genome alignments, annotation mapping from a suitable reference species and RNA-seq alignments (where RNA-seq data with appropriate meta data were publicly available). For each candidate gene region, a selection process was applied to choose the most appropriate set of transcripts based on evolutionary distance, experimental evidence for the source data and quality of the alignments.</br>Small ncRNAs were obtained using a combination of BLAST and Infernal/RNAfold.</br> Pseudogenes were calculated by looking at genes with a large percentage of non-biological introns (introns of &lt;10bp), where the gene was covered in repeats, or where the gene was single exon and evidence of a functional multi-exon paralog was found elsewhere in the genome.</br> lincRNAs were generated via RNA-seq data where no evidence of protein homology or protein domains could be found in the transcript.</p><p>In accordance with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lauderdale_Agreement">Fort Lauderdale Agreement </a>, please check the publication status of the genome/assembly before publishing any genome-wide analyses using these data.</p>
