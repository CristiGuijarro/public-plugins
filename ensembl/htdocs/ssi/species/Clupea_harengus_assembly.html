<p>The Ch_v2.0.2 assembly was submitted by Uppsala Univeristy on April 2019. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 1,989 contigs assembled into 26 scaffolds. From these sequences, 26 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 1,151,065 while the scaffold N50 is 30,022,480.</p>
