<p>The Fundulus_heteroclitus-3.0.2 assembly was submitted by The Genome Institute at Washington University School of Medicine on January 2015. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 120,723 contigs assembled into 10,180 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 16,688 while the scaffold N50 is 1,252,252.</p>
