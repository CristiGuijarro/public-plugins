<p>Cattle &mdash;colloquially cows&mdash; are the most common type of large domesticated ungulates. They are a prominent modern member of the subfamily Bovinae, are the most widespread species of the genus Bos, and are most commonly classified collectively as <i>Bos taurus</i>. In 2009, cattle became one of the first livestock animals to have a fully mapped genome.</p>
<p>Archeozoological and genetic data indicate that cattle were first domesticated from wild aurochs (<i>Bos primigenius</i>) approximately 10,500 years ago. There were two major areas of domestication: one in the Near East, giving rise to the taurine line, and a second in the area that is now Pakistan, resulting in the indicine line. Modern mitochondrial DNA variation indicates the taurine line may have arisen from as few as 80 aurochs tamed in the upper reaches of Mesopotamia near the villages of &Ccedil;ay&ouml;n&uuml; Tepesi in what is now southeastern Turkey and Dja'de el-Mughara in what is now northern Iraq.</p>
