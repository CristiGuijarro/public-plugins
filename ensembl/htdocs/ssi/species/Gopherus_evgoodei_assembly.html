<p>The rGopEvg1_v1.p assembly was submitted by Vertebrate Genomes Project on July 2019. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 933 contigs assembled into 383 scaffolds. From these sequences, 24 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 13,026,736 while the scaffold N50 is 147,425,149.</p>
