<p>The Melopsittacus_undulatus_6.3 assembly was submitted by The Genome Institute, Washington University at St. Louis on January 2012. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 70,863 contigs assembled into 25,212 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 55,633 while the scaffold N50 is 10,614,383.</p>
