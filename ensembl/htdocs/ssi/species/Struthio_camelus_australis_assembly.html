<p>The ASM69896v1 assembly was submitted by BGI on June 2014. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 79,564 contigs assembled into 6,915 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 34,997 while the scaffold N50 is 3,593,425.</p>
