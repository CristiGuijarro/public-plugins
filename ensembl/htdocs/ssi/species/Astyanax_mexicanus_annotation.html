<p>In Greek mythology, Astyanax (/&#x259;&#x2C8;sta&#x26A;.&#x259;n&aelig;ks/; Ancient Greek: &#x1F08;&sigma;&tau;&upsilon;&#x3AC;&nu;&alpha;&xi; Asty&aacute;nax, &quot;protector of the city&quot;) was the son of Hector, the crown prince of Troy, and his wife, Princess Andromache of Cilician Thebe. His birth name was Scamandrius (in Greek: &Sigma;&kappa;&alpha;&mu;&#x3AC;&nu;&delta;&rho;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf; Skamandrios, after the river Scamander), but the people of Troy nicknamed him Astyanax (i.e. high king, or overlord of the city), because he was the son of the city&#39;s great defender (Iliad VI, 403) and the heir apparent&#39;s firstborn son.During the Trojan War, Andromache hid the child in Hector&#39;s tomb, but the child was discovered. His fate was debated by the Greeks, for if he were allowed to live, it was feared he would avenge his father and rebuild Troy.  In the version given by the Little Iliad and repeated by Pausanias (x 25.4), he was killed by Neoptolemus (also called Pyrrhus), who threw the infant from the walls.  Another version is given in Iliou persis, in which Odysseus kills Astyanax. It has also been depicted in some Greek vases that Neoptolemus kills Priam, who has taken refuge near a sacred altar, using Astyanax&#39;s dead body to club the old king to death, in front of horrified onlookers.  In Ovid&#39;s Metamorphoses, the child is thrown from the walls by the Greek victors (13, 413ff). In Euripides&#39;s The Trojan Women (719 ff), the herald Talthybius reveals to Andromache that Odysseus has convinced the council to have the child thrown from the walls, and the child is in this way killed. In Seneca&#39;s version of The Trojan Women, the prophet Calchas declares that Astyanax must be thrown from the walls if the Greek fleet is to be allowed favorable winds (365&ndash;70), but once led to the tower, the child himself leaps off the walls (1100&ndash;3). Other sources for the story of the Sack of Troy and Astyanax&#39;s death can be found in the Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus), Hyginus (Fabula 109), Tryphiodorus (Sack of Troy 644&ndash;6).There are numerous traditions up through the Middle Ages and the Renaissance that have Astyanax survive the destruction of Troy:Astyanax is also the subject of several modern works:</p>
<p>The gene annotation process was carried out using a combination of protein-to-genome alignments, annotation mapping from a suitable reference species and RNA-seq alignments (where RNA-seq data with appropriate meta data were publicly available). For each candidate gene region, a selection process was applied to choose the most appropriate set of transcripts based on evolutionary distance, experimental evidence for the source data and quality of the alignments.</br>Small ncRNAs were obtained using a combination of BLAST and Infernal/RNAfold.</br> Pseudogenes were calculated by looking at genes with a large percentage of non-biological introns (introns of &lt;10bp), where the gene was covered in repeats, or where the gene was single exon and evidence of a functional multi-exon paralog was found elsewhere in the genome.</br> lincRNAs were generated via RNA-seq data where no evidence of protein homology or protein domains could be found in the transcript.</p><p>In accordance with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lauderdale_Agreement">Fort Lauderdale Agreement</a>, please check the publication status of the genome/assembly before publishing any genome-wide analyses using these data.</p>
