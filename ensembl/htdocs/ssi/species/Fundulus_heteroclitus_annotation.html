<p>The mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus) is a small killifish found along the Atlantic coast of the United States and
  Canada. Also known as Atlantic killifish, mummies, gudgeons, and mud minnows, these fish inhabit brackish and coastal
  waters including estuaries and salt marshes. The species is noted for its hardiness and ability to tolerate highly
  variable salinity, temperature fluctuations from 6 to 35&nbsp;&deg;C (43 to 95&nbsp;&deg;F), very low oxygen levels
  (down to 1&nbsp;mg/L), and heavily polluted ecosystems. As a result, the mummichog is a popular research subject in
  embryological, physiological, and toxicological studies. It is also the first fish ever sent to space, aboard Skylab
  in 1973.</p>
<p>The gene annotation process was carried out using a combination of protein-to-genome alignments, annotation mapping
  from a suitable reference species and RNA-seq alignments (where RNA-seq data with appropriate meta data were publicly
  available). For each candidate gene region, a selection process was applied to choose the most appropriate set of
  transcripts based on evolutionary distance, experimental evidence for the source data and quality of the alignments.
  Small ncRNAs were obtained using a combination of BLAST and Infernal/RNAfold. Pseudogenes were calculated by looking
  at genes with a large percentage of non-biological introns (introns of &lt;10bp), where the gene was covered in
  repeats, or where the gene was single exon and evidence of a functional multi-exon paralog was found elsewhere in the
  genome. lincRNAs were generated via RNA-seq data where no evidence of protein homology or protein domains could
  be found in the transcript.</p>
