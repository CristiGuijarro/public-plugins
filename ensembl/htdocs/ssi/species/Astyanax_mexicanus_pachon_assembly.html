<p>The Astyanax_mexicanus-1.0.2 assembly was submitted by Aquatic Genome Models on April 2019. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 121,345 contigs assembled into 10,735 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 14,739 while the scaffold N50 is 1,775,308.</p>
