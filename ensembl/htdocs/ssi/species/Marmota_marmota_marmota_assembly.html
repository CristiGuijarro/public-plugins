<p>The marMar2.1 assembly was submitted by Mrc National Institute For Medical Research on December 2015. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 77,915 contigs assembled into 14,543 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 66,492 while the scaffold N50 is 31,340,621.</p>
