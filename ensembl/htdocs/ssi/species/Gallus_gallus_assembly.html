<p>The GRCg6a assembly was submitted by Genome Reference Consortium on April 2018. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 1,403 contigs assembled into 525 scaffolds. From these sequences, 34 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 17,655,422 while the scaffold N50 is 20,785,086.</p>
