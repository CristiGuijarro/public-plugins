<p>The C.can genome v1.0 assembly was submitted by Hospital for Sick Children on February 2017. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 24,477 contigs assembled into 21,157 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 273,954 while the scaffold N50 is 317,708.</p>
