<p>The PunNye1.0 assembly was submitted by Broad Institute on December 2011. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 68,053 contigs assembled into 7,236 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 22,622 while the scaffold N50 is 2,525,540.</p>
