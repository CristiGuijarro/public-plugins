<p>The P_mexicana-1.0 assembly was submitted by The Genome Institute at Washington University School of Medicine (WUGSC) on November 2015. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 50,601 contigs assembled into 18,105 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 39,840 while the scaffold N50 is 275,316.</p>
