<p>The Midas cichlid, <i>Amphilophus citrinellus</i>, is a large cichlid fish endemic to the San Juan River and adjacent watersheds in Costa Rica and Nicaragua. A few to perhaps several dozen species are considered to exist among what has historically been called <i>A. citrinellus</i>, the great majority of which have not been described to date.</p>
<p>Considerable debate over the taxonomic status of <i>A. citrinellus</i> began soon after the discovery of this species in the nineteenth century. Multiple members of this speces complex have been identified and verified by genomic and mitochondrial DNA evidence in volcanic crater lakes Apoyo and Xilo&aacute;. The genetic evidence from Apoyo supports a hypothesis that the six known species of the lake evolved via sympatric speciation. The nine most recently described members of this species complex are considered endemic to their respective small, volcanic crater lakes.</p>
