<p>The ASM331708v1 assembly was submitted by University Of Aberdeen on July 2018. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 221,746 contigs assembled into 71,639 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 37,639 while the scaffold N50 is 287,338.</p>
