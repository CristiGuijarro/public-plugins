<p>The phaCin_tgac_v2.0 assembly was submitted by Koala Genome Consortium on May 2018. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 819,636 contigs assembled into 796,464 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 126,882 while the scaffold N50 is 798,273.</p>
