<p>The phaCin_unsw_v4.1 assembly was submitted by The Earlham Institute on April 2017. The assembly is on contig level, consisting of 1,907 contigs assembled into 1,907 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 11,587,828 while the scaffold N50 is 11,587,828.</p>
