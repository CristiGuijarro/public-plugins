<p>The vervet or African green monkey (<i>Chlorocebus sabaeus</i>) is originally from West Africa but was introduced in the late 1600s to the Caribbean. The species is one of the most important non-human primate models in medical research, particularly in studying high blood pressure and AIDS, since it is a host for simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) but does not progress to disease.</p>
