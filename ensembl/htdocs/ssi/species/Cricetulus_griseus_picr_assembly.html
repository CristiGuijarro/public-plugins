<p>The CriGri-PICR assembly was submitted by CHO Genome Community on October 2018. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 4,825 contigs assembled into 1,830 scaffolds. From these sequences, 11 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 2,098,530 while the scaffold N50 is 19,581,774.</p>
