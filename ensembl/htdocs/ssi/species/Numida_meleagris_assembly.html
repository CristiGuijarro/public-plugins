<p>The NumMel1.0 assembly was submitted by INRA on June 2017. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 16,014 contigs assembled into 2,739 scaffolds. From these sequences, 31 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 234,926 while the scaffold N50 is 7,868,035.</p>
