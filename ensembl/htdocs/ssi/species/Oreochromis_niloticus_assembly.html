<p>The O_niloticus_UMD_NMBU assembly was submitted by University of Maryland on June 2018. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 3,010 contigs assembled into 2,460 scaffolds. From these sequences, 22 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 2,923,640 while the scaffold N50 is 38,839,487.</p>
