<p>The ASM228892v3 assembly was submitted by BC Cancer Agency on September 2019. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 29,444 contigs assembled into 5,905 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 196,689 while the scaffold N50 is 31,183,418.</p>
