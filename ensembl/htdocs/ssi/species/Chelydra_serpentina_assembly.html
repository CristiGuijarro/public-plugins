<p>The Chelydra_serpentina-1.0 assembly was submitted by McDonnell Genome Institute - Washington University School of Medicine on August 2019. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 165,807 contigs assembled into 113,431 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 80,593 while the scaffold N50 is 21,135,443.</p>
