<p>The channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) is North America&#39;s most numerous catfish species. It is the official
  fish of Kansas, Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, and Tennessee, and is informally referred to as a &quot;channel cat&quot;.
  In the United States, they are the most fished catfish species with around 8 million anglers targeting them per year.
  The popularity of channel catfish for food has contributed to the rapid expansion of aquaculture of this species in
  the United States.</p>
<p>The gene annotation process was carried out using a combination of protein-to-genome alignments, annotation mapping
  from a suitable reference species and RNA-seq alignments (where RNA-seq data with appropriate meta data were publicly
  available). For each candidate gene region, a selection process was applied to choose the most appropriate set of
  transcripts based on evolutionary distance, experimental evidence for the source data and quality of the alignments.
  Small ncRNAs were obtained using a combination of BLAST and Infernal/RNAfold. Pseudogenes were calculated by looking
  at genes with a large percentage of non-biological introns (introns of &lt;10bp), where the gene was covered in
  repeats, or where the gene was single exon and evidence of a functional multi-exon paralog was found elsewhere in the
  genome. lincRNAs were generated via RNA-seq data where no evidence of protein homology or protein domains could
  be found in the transcript.</p>
