<p>The Sedor1 assembly was submitted by Iowa State University on December 2017. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 133,262 contigs assembled into 99,598 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 51,346 while the scaffold N50 is 1,269,737.</p>
