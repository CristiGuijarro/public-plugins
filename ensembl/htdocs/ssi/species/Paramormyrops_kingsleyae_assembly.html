<p>The PKINGS_0.1 assembly was submitted by Michigan State University on January 2018. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 47,999 contigs assembled into 4,667 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 37,656 while the scaffold N50 is 1,731,158.</p>
