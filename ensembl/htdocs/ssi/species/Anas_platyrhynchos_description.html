<p>The mallard (<i>Anas platyrhynchos</i>) is a dabbling duck that breeds throughout the temperate and subtropical Americas, Eurasia, and North Africa and has been widely introduced around the globe. Unlike many waterfowl, mallards are considered an invasive species in some regions. The non-migratory mallard interbreeds with indigenous wild ducks of closely related species, producing fertile offspring.</p>
<p>Mallards are differentiated in their mitochondrial DNA between North American and Eurasian populations, but the nuclear genome displays a notable lack of genetic structure. Mitochondrial DNA data for the D-loop sequence suggests that mallards may have evolved in the general area of Siberia. Mallard bones rather abruptly appear in food remains of ancient humans and other deposits of fossil bones in Europe, without a good candidate for a local predecessor species.</p>
