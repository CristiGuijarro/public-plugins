<p>The SAMN03320097.WGS_v1.1 assembly was submitted by BGI, Shenzhen on January 2016. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 168,074 contigs assembled into 31,277 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 29,353 while the scaffold N50 is 1,156,368.</p>
