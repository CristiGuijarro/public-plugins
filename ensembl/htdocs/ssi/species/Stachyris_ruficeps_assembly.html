<p>The ASM869450v1 assembly was submitted by Academia Sinica on September 2019. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 20,101 contigs assembled into 7,756 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 194,313 while the scaffold N50 is 15,643,638.</p>
