<p>The fBetSpl5.2 assembly was submitted by SC on May 2019. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 398 contigs assembled into 70 scaffolds. From these sequences, 21 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 2,497,747 while the scaffold N50 is 20,129,463.</p>
