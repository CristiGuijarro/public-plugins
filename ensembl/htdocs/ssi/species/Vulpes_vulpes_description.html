<p>The red fox (<i>Vulpes vulpes</i>) is the largest of the true foxes and one of the most widely distributed members of the
  order Carnivora, being present across the entire Northern Hemisphere from the Arctic Circle to North Africa, North
  America and Eurasia. Too small to pose a threat to humans, it has extensively benefited from the presence of human habitation, and has successfully colonised many suburban and urban areas.</p>
