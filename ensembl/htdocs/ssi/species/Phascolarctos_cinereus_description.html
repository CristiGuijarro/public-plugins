<p>The koala (<i>Phascolarctos cinereus</i>) is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to
  Australia. It is the only extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae and its closest living relatives are
  the wombats, which comprise the family Vombatidae.</p> 
  <p>Koalas typically inhabit open eucalypt woodlands, and the leaves of these
  trees make up most of their diet. Because this diet has limited nutritional and caloric content, koalas are
  largely sedentary and sleep up to 20 hours a day.
