<p>The ASM128173v1 assembly was submitted by Imperial College London on September 2015. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 62,852 contigs assembled into 2,933 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 34,514 while the scaffold N50 is 3,581,248.</p>
