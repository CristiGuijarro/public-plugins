<p>The ASM259213v1 assembly was submitted by Aarhus University, Denmark on October 2017. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 28,533 contigs assembled into 2,723 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 97,462 while the scaffold N50 is 4,974,386.</p>
