<p>The Chrysolophus_pictus_GenomeV1.0 assembly was submitted by Inner Mongolia Agricultural University on August 2018. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 65,464 contigs assembled into 14,294 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 38,217 while the scaffold N50 is 1,560,063.</p>
