<p>The ASB_HGAPassembly_v1 assembly was submitted by Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory on December 2017. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 3,917 contigs assembled into 3,807 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 1,066,117 while the scaffold N50 is 1,191,366.</p>
