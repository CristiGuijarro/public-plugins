<p>The ASM275486v1 assembly was submitted by Broad Institute on November 2017. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 88,439 contigs assembled into 39,944 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 155,284 while the scaffold N50 is 129,239,660.</p>
