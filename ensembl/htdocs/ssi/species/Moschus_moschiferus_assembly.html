<p>The MosMos_v2_BIUU_UCD assembly was submitted by Broad Institute on July 2019. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 1,195,517 contigs assembled into 1,072,499 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 34,785 while the scaffold N50 is 11,728,851.</p>
