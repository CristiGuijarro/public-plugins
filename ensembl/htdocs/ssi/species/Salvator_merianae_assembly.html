<p>The HLtupMer3 assembly was submitted by Center for Systems Biology Dresden on September 2018. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 38,189 contigs assembled into 5,988 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 167,260 while the scaffold N50 is 28,146,161.</p>
