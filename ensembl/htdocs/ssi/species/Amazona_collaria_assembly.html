<p>The ASM394721v1 assembly was submitted by Weill Cornell Medicine on December 2018. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 22,614 contigs assembled into 10,638 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 208,912 while the scaffold N50 is 13,267,695.</p>
