<p>Astatotilapia burtoni is a species of fish in the family Cichlidae.It is found in Burundi, Rwanda, Tanzania, and
  Zambia.Its natural habitats are rivers, intermittent rivers, swamps, freshwater lakes, freshwater marshes,
  intermittent freshwater marshes, and inland deltas.Astatotilapia burtoni has been used as a model organism to study
  the behaviors and physical systems of cichlids, including their development and embryogenesis. Moreover, the
  phylogenetic position of this particular species makes it an ideal model system for comparative genomic research. A.
  burtoni belongs under the haplochromines, which is the lineage of cichlids with the most species, and has been
  discovered to be a sister group to both the Lake Victoria region superflock (which has about 600 species) and the
  species flock of Lake Malawi (which has about 1,000 species).</p>
<p>The gene annotation process was carried out using a combination of protein-to-genome alignments, annotation mapping
  from a suitable reference species and RNA-seq alignments (where RNA-seq data with appropriate meta data were publicly
  available). For each candidate gene region, a selection process was applied to choose the most appropriate set of
  transcripts based on evolutionary distance, experimental evidence for the source data and quality of the alignments.
  Small ncRNAs were obtained using a combination of BLAST and Infernal/RNAfold. Pseudogenes were calculated by looking
  at genes with a large percentage of non-biological introns (introns of &lt;10bp), where the gene was covered in
  repeats, or where the gene was single exon and evidence of a functional multi-exon paralog was found elsewhere in the
  genome. lincRNAs were generated via RNA-seq data where no evidence of protein homology or protein domains could
  be found in the transcript.</p>
