<p>Larimichthys crocea, called the  large yellow croaker, the yellow croaker or the croceine croaker, is a species of marine fish in the croaker family (Sciaenidae) native to the northwestern Pacific, generally in temperate waters such as the Taiwan Strait. It lives in coastal waters and estuaries, often in brackish water also, and is found on muddy-sandy bottoms. Males can reach 80&nbsp;cm, but a common size is 60&nbsp;cm.Once an abundant commercial fish off China, Korea, Taiwan and Japan, its population collapsed in the 1970s due to overfishing. Fishing boats landed 56,000 tonnes of Larimichthys crocea in 2008, and 91,000 tonnes in 2013. The species is now aquafarmed in China, and production has grown to 105,000 tonnes by 2013. Farms have experienced outbreaks of Nocardia seriolae infections.L. crocea is an important enough commercial species to have its genome mapped in 2014. On 6 January 2015 it became the 200th organism to have its genome annotated by the NCBI Eukaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline.</p>
<p>The gene annotation process was carried out using a combination of protein-to-genome alignments, annotation mapping from a suitable reference species and RNA-seq alignments (where RNA-seq data with appropriate meta data were publicly available). For each candidate gene region, a selection process was applied to choose the most appropriate set of transcripts based on evolutionary distance, experimental evidence for the source data and quality of the alignments.</br>Small ncRNAs were obtained using a combination of BLAST and Infernal/RNAfold.</br> Pseudogenes were calculated by looking at genes with a large percentage of non-biological introns (introns of &lt;10bp), where the gene was covered in repeats, or where the gene was single exon and evidence of a functional multi-exon paralog was found elsewhere in the genome.</br> lincRNAs were generated via RNA-seq data where no evidence of protein homology or protein domains could be found in the transcript.</p><p>In accordance with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lauderdale_Agreement">Fort Lauderdale Agreement</a>, please check the publication status of the genome/assembly before publishing any genome-wide analyses using these data.</p>
