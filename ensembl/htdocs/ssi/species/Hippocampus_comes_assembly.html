<p>The H_comes_QL1_v1 assembly was submitted by South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences on December 2016. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 60,478 contigs assembled into 37,377 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 39,546 while the scaffold N50 is 2,034,572.</p>
