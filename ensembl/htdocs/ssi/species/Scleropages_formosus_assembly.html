<p>The ASM162426v1 assembly was submitted by BGI-SZ on April 2016. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 55,899 contigs assembled into 4,819 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 30,793 while the scaffold N50 is 5,965,175.</p>
