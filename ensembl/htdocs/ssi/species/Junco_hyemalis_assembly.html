<p>The ASM382977v1 assembly was submitted by National Museum of Natural Sciences on November 2018. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 48,637 contigs assembled into 4,457 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 80,164 while the scaffold N50 is 71,317,294.</p>
