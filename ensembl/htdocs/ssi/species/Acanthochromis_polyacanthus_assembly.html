<p>The ASM210954v1 assembly was submitted by King Abdullah University of Science and technology on April 2017. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 159,493 contigs assembled into 30,414 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 16,099 while the scaffold N50 is 334,400.</p>
