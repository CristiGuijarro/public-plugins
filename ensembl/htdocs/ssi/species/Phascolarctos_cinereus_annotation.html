<p>The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus, or, inaccurately, koala bear) is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to
  Australia. It is the only extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae and its closest living relatives are
  the wombats, which comprise the family Vombatidae.. The koala is found in coastal areas of the mainland&#39;s eastern
  and southern regions, inhabiting Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. It is easily
  recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large head with round, fluffy ears and large, spoon-shaped nose. The
  koala has a body length of 60&ndash;85&nbsp;cm (24&ndash;33&nbsp;in) and weighs 4&ndash;15&nbsp;kg
  (9&ndash;33&nbsp;lb). Pelage colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown. Koalas from the northern populations
  are typically smaller and lighter in colour than their counterparts further south. These populations possibly are
  separate subspecies, but this is disputed.Koalas typically inhabit open eucalypt woodlands, and the leaves of these
  trees make up most of their diet. Because this eucalypt diet has limited nutritional and caloric content, koalas are
  largely sedentary and sleep up to 20 hours a day. They are asocial animals, and bonding exists only between mothers
  and dependent offspring. Adult males communicate with loud bellows that intimidate rivals and attract mates. Males
  mark their presence with secretions from scent glands located on their chests. Being marsupials, koalas give birth to
  underdeveloped young that crawl into their mothers&#39; pouches, where they stay for the first six to seven months of
  their lives. These young koalas, known as joeys, are fully weaned around a year old. Koalas have few natural
  predators and parasites, but are threatened by various pathogens, such as Chlamydiaceae bacteria and the koala
  retrovirus, as well as by bushfires and droughts.Koalas were hunted by Indigenous Australians and depicted in myths
  and cave art for millennia. The first recorded encounter between a European and a koala was in 1798, and an image of
  the animal was published in 1810 by naturalist George Perry. Botanist Robert Brown wrote the first detailed
  scientific description of the koala in 1814, although his work remained unpublished for 180 years. Popular artist
  John Gould illustrated and described the koala, introducing the species to the general British public. Further
  details about the animal&#39;s biology were revealed in the 19th century by several English scientists. Because of
  its distinctive appearance, the koala is recognised worldwide as a symbol of Australia. Koalas are listed as
  Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The Australian government similarly lists specific
  populations in Queensland and New South Wales as Vulnerable. The animal was hunted heavily in the early 20th century
  for its fur, and large-scale cullings in Queensland resulted in a public outcry that initiated a movement to protect
  the species. Sanctuaries were established, and translocation efforts moved to new regions koalas whose habitat had
  become fragmented or reduced. The biggest threat to their existence is habitat destruction caused by agriculture and
  urbanisation.</p>
<p>The gene annotation process was carried out using a combination of protein-to-genome alignments, annotation mapping
  from a suitable reference species and RNA-seq alignments (where RNA-seq data with appropriate meta data were publicly
  available). For each candidate gene region, a selection process was applied to choose the most appropriate set of
  transcripts based on evolutionary distance, experimental evidence for the source data and quality of the alignments.
  Small ncRNAs were obtained using a combination of BLAST and Infernal/RNAfold. Pseudogenes were calculated by looking
  at genes with a large percentage of non-biological introns (introns of &lt;10bp), where the gene was covered in
  repeats, or where the gene was single exon and evidence of a functional multi-exon paralog was found elsewhere in the
  genome. lincRNAs were generated via RNA-seq data where no evidence of protein homology or protein domains could
  be found in the transcript.</p>
