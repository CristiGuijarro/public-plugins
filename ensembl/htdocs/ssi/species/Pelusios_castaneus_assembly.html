<p>The Pelusios_castaneus-1.0 assembly was submitted by McDonnell Genome Institute - Washington University School of Medicine on August 2019. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 112,514 contigs assembled into 69,036 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 74,864 while the scaffold N50 is 14,055,032.</p>
