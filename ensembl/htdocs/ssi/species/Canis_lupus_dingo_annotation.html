<p>Canis lupus dingo is a taxonomic rank that includes both the dingo that is native to Australia and the rare New Guinea singing dog that is native to the New Guinea Highlands. It also includes some extinct dogs that were once found in coastal Papua New Guinea and the island of Java in the Indonesian Archipelago. It is a subspecies of Canis lupus. The genetic evidence indicates that the dingo clade originated from East Asian domestic dogs and was introduced through the Malay Archipelago into Australia, with a common ancestry between the Australian dingo and the New Guinea singing dog.</p>
<p>The gene annotation process was carried out using a combination of protein-to-genome alignments, annotation mapping from a suitable reference species and RNA-seq alignments (where RNA-seq data with appropriate meta data were publicly available). For each candidate gene region, a selection process was applied to choose the most appropriate set of transcripts based on evolutionary distance, experimental evidence for the source data and quality of the alignments.</br>Small ncRNAs were obtained using a combination of BLAST and Infernal/RNAfold.</br> Pseudogenes were calculated by looking at genes with a large percentage of non-biological introns (introns of &lt;10bp), where the gene was covered in repeats, or where the gene was single exon and evidence of a functional multi-exon paralog was found elsewhere in the genome.</br> lincRNAs were generated via RNA-seq data where no evidence of protein homology or protein domains could be found in the transcript.</p><p>In accordance with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lauderdale_Agreement">Fort Lauderdale Agreement</a>, please check the publication status of the genome/assembly before publishing any genome-wide analyses using these data.</p>
