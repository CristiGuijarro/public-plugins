<p>The Sdu_1.0 assembly was submitted by Genomic breeding group, Research Center for Aquatic Breeding, National Research Institute of aquaculture, FRA on August 2017. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 41,188 contigs assembled into 34,656 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 249,509 while the scaffold N50 is 5,812,906.</p>
