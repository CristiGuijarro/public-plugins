<p>The Zonotrichia_albicollis-1.0.1 assembly was submitted by White-throated sparrow consortium on April 2013. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 37,661 contigs assembled into 6,018 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 112,748 while the scaffold N50 is 4,866,725.</p>
