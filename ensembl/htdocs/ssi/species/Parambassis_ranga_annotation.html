<p>Parambassis ranga, commonly known as the Indian glassy fish, Indian glassy perch, or Indian X-ray fish, is a species of freshwater fish in the Asiatic glassfish family Ambassidae of order Perciformes. It is native to an area of South Asia from Pakistan to Malaysia.The Indian glassy fish has a striking transparent body, revealing its bones and internal organs; the male develops a dark edge to the dorsal fin. The fish grows to a maximum overall length of 80&nbsp;mm (3.1&nbsp;in).It occurs in standing water, especially in impoundments, and it breeds prolifically during the rainy season. The species feeds on crustaceans, annelid worms, and other invertebrates. It is, in turn, prey for larger fish, including snakeheads (family Channidae).The Indian glassy fish is not important as a food fish for humans, but is very common in the aquarium trade.Formerly classified as Chanda ranga, the species is also known as the Indian glassfish, Indian glass perch, and Siamese glassfish.Glassfish have been kept in aquarium for many years, but have a reputation for being delicate and difficult to keep. This may be related to a persistent myth that these fish need brackish water. In the wild, they more commonly inhabit fresh water, and in captivity do well in slightly soft to moderately hard dGH 7&ndash;19, slightly acidic to slightly alkaline water pH 6.5&ndash;7.5.  They can tolerate a temperature range of 20&ndash;30&nbsp;&deg;C (68&ndash;86&nbsp;&deg;F).These fish swim at the middle and lower levels of the tank, and will take most small live and frozen foods. In general, they tend not to eat dried foods (such as flake).
The fish reproduce by laying the eggs (females) and then the males fertilise the eggs.Indian glassy fish sold to hobbyists have often been &quot;painted&quot;, which involves injecting coloured dye into the fish&#39;s transparent tissue to make them more attractive to hobbyists. These coloured fish are often called &quot;disco fish&quot;. Inexperienced fishkeepers are often tricked into believing such fish are natural or that the process is painless and causes no harm. Fish thus treated have suffered trauma and are susceptible to disease, including Ichthyophthirius multifiliis infection, fin rot, and the viral disease lymphocystis. The artificial coloration often fades within a short time. Healthy, unpainted specimens may live three to four years in captivity, but such individuals may be difficult to find in some localities.</p>
<p>The gene annotation process was carried out using a combination of protein-to-genome alignments, annotation mapping from a suitable reference species and RNA-seq alignments (where RNA-seq data with appropriate meta data were publicly available). For each candidate gene region, a selection process was applied to choose the most appropriate set of transcripts based on evolutionary distance, experimental evidence for the source data and quality of the alignments.</br>Small ncRNAs were obtained using a combination of BLAST and Infernal/RNAfold.</br> Pseudogenes were calculated by looking at genes with a large percentage of non-biological introns (introns of &lt;10bp), where the gene was covered in repeats, or where the gene was single exon and evidence of a functional multi-exon paralog was found elsewhere in the genome.</br> lincRNAs were generated via RNA-seq data where no evidence of protein homology or protein domains could be found in the transcript.</p><p>In accordance with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lauderdale_Agreement">Fort Lauderdale Agreement</a>, please check the publication status of the genome/assembly before publishing any genome-wide analyses using these data.</p>
