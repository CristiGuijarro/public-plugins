<p>The ASM311381v1 assembly was submitted by University of Otago and Ngatiwai iwi on May 2018. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 272,689 contigs assembled into 16,536 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 27,065 while the scaffold N50 is 3,052,611.</p>
