<p>The ASM966005v1 assembly was submitted by Northwestern Polytechnical University on November 2019. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 54,646 contigs assembled into 24,973 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 145,966 while the scaffold N50 is 26,803,000.</p>
