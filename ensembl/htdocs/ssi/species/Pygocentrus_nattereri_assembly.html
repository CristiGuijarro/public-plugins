<p>The Pygocentrus_nattereri-1.0.2 assembly was submitted by McDonnell Genome Institute on July 2016. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 325,620 contigs assembled into 283,518 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 57,732 while the scaffold N50 is 1,440,044.</p>
