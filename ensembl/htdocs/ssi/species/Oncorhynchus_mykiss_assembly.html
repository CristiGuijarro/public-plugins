<p>The Omyk_1.0 assembly was submitted by USDA/ARS on June 2017. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 559,855 contigs assembled into 139,800 scaffolds. From these sequences, 29 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 13,827 while the scaffold N50 is 1,670,138.</p>
