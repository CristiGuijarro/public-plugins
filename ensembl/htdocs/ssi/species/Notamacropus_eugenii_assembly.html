<p>The Meug_1.1 assembly was submitted by Tammar Wallaby Genome Sequencing Consortium on January 2010. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 1,174,382 contigs assembled into 277,711 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 2,602 while the scaffold N50 is 36,602.</p>
